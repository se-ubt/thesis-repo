# How to use this thesis repo

The main file for you to modify is [thesis-proposal.tex](https://github.com/se-ubt/thesis-repo/blob/main/thesis-proposal.tex).
You should only edit this file (and not [README.md](https://github.com/se-ubt/thesis-repo/blob/main/README.md) directly), as it allows you to maintain your references in [literature.bib](https://github.com/se-ubt/thesis-repo/blob/main/literature.bib) and use the latex `\cite` command to refer to them.
Please use the [DBLP](https://dblp.org/) Bibtex entries, if available.
You can use the script [compile-latex.sh](https://github.com/se-ubt/thesis-repo/blob/main/compile-latex.sh) to update the [README.md](https://github.com/se-ubt/thesis-repo/blob/main/README.md) file, which is automatically shown on the GitHub website of this repo.
